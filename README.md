# Hack Day Sudoku

## By Levi McGlone

This is a small sudoku game I wrote for a hackday project at Root.  The goal of the project was to learn about game development in libGDX.  I chose Sudoku because the game logic was straightforward, and it gave me some experience handling mouse input and key presses.
